# Shift-Reminder
A program that reads work shifts for a specific person from the Foti International Fireworks and populates their digital calendar with their shifts as events with details including, time, location etc.
After a shift has been completed this program will also append that shift to the workers display log and fill in available details to ensure proper record keeping.
